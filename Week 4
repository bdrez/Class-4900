This week I finally finished up the report I've been working on. It took way longer than it should've due to the fact that this site had many issues and problems. 
Additionally, I also started working on a new site. On Thursday I had to deal with an emergency. The site i previously set server went down because it had way
too many cameras on a  server. It was not load balanced at all. We also had some synchronization issues we were able to fix by virtually logging onto the server. 
I learned how to set up a new archiver in Gentec as well as delete old footage that has passed the 60 day mark. I also sent out my first updated report this week!

This week I learned about the concept of Daisy changing. ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¼
The official definition according to the Miriam-Webster dictionary is "to link (things, such as computer components) together in series".

I've attached the article above for a better understanding. If our two servers had used this technique, this issue likely would not have happened.

Another thing I mentioned this week is load balancing. 
Load balancing distributes the workload across multiple resources which helps prevent overloading of any single resource. 
In my case this week we had to create another archiver on Genetec so we can load balance and not run into this issue again.
A couple of advantages of load balancing are optimization of resource and response time.
