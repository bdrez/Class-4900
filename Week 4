This week i finally finished up the report ive been working on. It took way longer than it shouldve due to the fact that this site had many issues and problems. 
Additionally, i also started working on a new site. On Thursday i had to deal with an emergency. The site i previosuly set server went down becuase it had way
too many cameras on a  server. It was not load balanced at all. We also had some syncrhoinzation issue we were able to fix by viritually logging onto the server. 
I learned how to set up a new archiver in Gentec as well as delete old footage that is passed the 60 day mark. I also send out my first updated report this week
