This week i finally finished up the report ive been working on. It took way longer than it shouldve due to the fact that this site had many issues and problems. 
Additionally, i also started working on a new site. On Thursday i had to deal with an emergency. The site i previosuly set server went down becuase it had way
too many cameras on a  server. It was not load balanced at all.
