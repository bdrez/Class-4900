This week I finished up a report and almost completed a second one. I worked on a site where all the cameras were the same model so that was a nice treat since usually i have 
to set them to a bunch of different models. Almost all the cameras at that site were installed upside down so I got to play extra with those cameras. We once again had off for 
the holiday so it was nice for me to observe the holiday. On friday i went to two different schools to observe they were both very old so some of the equipment was not up to 
to par, but i went with my fellow intern so i had fun. At my second site i learned how to fix a dual monitor setup where the screen.
