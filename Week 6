This week I finished up a report and almost completed a second one. I worked on a site where all the cameras were the same model so that was a nice treat since usually i
have to set the software of a bunch of different model types. Almost all the cameras at that site were installed upside down so I got to play around extra with those 
cameras. We once again had off for the holiday so it was nice for me to observe these holidays. On Friday i went to two different schools to survey they were both very 
old, so some of the equipment was not up to par, but I went with my fellow intern so I had fun. At my second site I learned how to fix a dual monitor setup where the 
screens were reversed and misaligned. 


How to fix a dual monitor that is misaligned. 
1- right click on the desktop
2- select dual display- there you will see the two monitor boxes that are labeled 1 and 2
3-click on identify and it will put a number at the left/right hand corner of the screen you are currently using (it will either be 1 or 2)
4- click and drag the monitor box so they are in the correct order (how the monitors are physically positioned)
4- click apply

Then your two monitors should be aligned correctly.
