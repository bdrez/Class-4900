This week I finished working on the hybrid site after I met with one of my supervisors to discuss the difference between a site with more than one brand of cameras. I went 
on a site visit to the hybrid school. This allowed me to go over the site pictures and completely finish the report. Aditionally, i attended my week 8 lecture for codepath 
and worked on the last individual assignment. On a similar note, i started studying for the ISC2 CC which i am able to take for free due to being a memember of WiCyS.
