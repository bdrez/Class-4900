This week I finished working on the hybrid site after I met with one of my supervisors to discuss the difference between a site with more than one brand of cameras. I went 
on a site visit to the hybrid school. This allowed me to go over the site pictures and completely finish the report. Additionally, I attended my week 8 lecture for codepath 
and worked on the last individual assignment. On a similar note, I started studying for the ISC2 CC which I am able to take for free due to being a member of WiCyS. 

This week i will explain the difference between LAN, VLAN and WAN:

Networking is simply two or more computers linked together to share data, information, and resources.

LAN- Local Area Network- This network typically spans a single floor or building and is commonly used for a limited geographical area. 
VLAN
WAN- Wide Area Network- This network is a long distance connection between geographically remote networks.
