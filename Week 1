Due to personal reasons and the fact that ive been working since March and through out the summer i did not work this week. 
Since i did not work this week i will explain a little about what we do at the DOE on the IPDVS team. 
IPDVS stands for Internal Protocal Digital Video Surivellence.  In short out team ensures that the camera in public schools all over the 5 Boroughs are set up
correctly and working. In a week i can doing anything from a remote assessment ensuring that the software is setup correct and working, going on site to survey
cameras at public schools to ensure proper set up, remotely fix cameras software for better quality or from error, as well as set up and configer cameras and applications.
