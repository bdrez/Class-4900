Due to personal reasons and the fact that ive been working since March and through out the summer i did not work this week. 
Since i did not work this week i will explain a little what we do at the DOE on the IPDVS team. 
IPDVS stands for Internal Protocal Digital Video Surivellence.  In short out team ensures that the camera in public schools all over the 5 Boroughs are set up
correctly and working. In a week i can be doing anything from doing a remote assessment and making sure the software is correct,
