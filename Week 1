Due to personal reasons, and the fact that I've been working since March and through out the summer, I did not work this week. 
Since I did not work this week, I will explain a little bit about what I do at the DOE on the IPDVS team. 
IPDVS stands for Internal Protocal Digital Video Surivellence. In short, our team ensures that the surveillance systems in public 
schools all over the 5 boroughs are set up and working properly. In a regular week, I may be doing anything from a remote assessment 
ensuring that the software is set up and functioning correctly by remotely fixing cameras' software for better quality or from error,
as well as set up and configure cameras and their applications, to going on site to survey cameras at public schools and ensuring the hardware is correct.
