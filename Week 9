This week I finished up a report and went through the camera field of views making sure they are capturing the intended view and the cameras are working well. I also meet 
with my fellow intern because I had some questions about the on site photos she took. I finished up that report and started going over photos for a different site. Where 
the assessment report is almost done and all that's left to do is go through the on site pictures and make sure that the hardware is set up correctly and we were given the 
correct information. I also attended my code path class CYB102 and spend some time working on the homework. 

This week i will explain some of the equipment we check on in the MDF room and what they do:

UPS- The UPS provides the short-term back up power to keep a system running if the main power fails.
Server-A server is a computer/system that provides data, services, or other resources to other computers on the network. 
Switch- The switch is a hardware device that combines multiple devices into a local area network (LAN).
