This week i finished up a report and went through the camera field of views making sure they are capturing the intended view and the camers are working well. I also meet with
my fellow intern because i had some question about the on site photos she took. I finsihed up that report and started going over photos for a differnet site. Where the assessment
report is almost done and all thats left to do is go through the on site pictures and make sure that the hardware is set up correctly and we were given the correct information.
