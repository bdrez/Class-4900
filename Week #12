This week i did alot. I checked the cameras of a school who just got theirs fixed to make sure that it was working properlly and the footage was being stored. I also did some
cybersecuirty training at work. It was fun to see the other side of attending these lectures vs what ive been studying and learn in the past few months. I counted working on 
my report that i started inclduing remotely connecting to the server to check their cameras are set up properrly adn owrking well. I went on site to the school taking pictures
and checking out our hardware and some of the software at that school. I went through those pictures and finished up the report.
