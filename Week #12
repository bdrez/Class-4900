This week I did a lot. I checked the cameras of a school who just got theirs fixed to make sure that it was working properly and the footage was being stored. I also did 
some cybersecurity training at work. It was fun to see the other side of attending these lectures vs what I've been studying and learning in the past few months. I 
countinued working on my report that i started including remotely connecting to the server to check that their cameras are set up properly and working well. I went on site 
to the school taking pictures and checking out our hardware and some of the software at that school. I went through those pictures and finished up the report. 

Additionaly, this week i attened my codepath lecture and working on the capstone project with my group as well as indiividually. I also continued studyin for the ISC2 CC, 
which i hope to take in the next week or two.
