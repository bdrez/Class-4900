This week I did a lot. I checked the cameras of a school who just got theirs fixed to make sure that it was working properly and the footage was being stored. I also did 
some cybersecurity training at work. It was fun to see the other side of attending these lectures vs what I've been studying and learning in the past few months. I counted 
working on my report that i started including remotely connecting to the server to check their cameras are set up properly and working well. I went on site to the school
taking pictures and checking out our hardware and some of the software at that school. I went through those pictures and finished up the report.
