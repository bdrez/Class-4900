This week was a busy one because we didn't have college and had off at work for the Jewish Holiday. On the days that I did work I finished up a report I was working on. I
I got to play around with a camera and fix their field of view which I have done in a bit and it was fun to get to do it again. I also worked on a couple of report 
updates. It's something I recently learned so it takes a bit longer. It also really depends on how much you have to update. I also started a new report.
