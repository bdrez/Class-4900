This week was a busy one becasue we didnt have college and had off at work for the Jewish Holiday. On the days that i did work i finished up a report i was working on. I
got to play around with a camera and fix their feild of veiws which i have done in a bit and was fun to get to do it again. I also worked on a couple of report updates. 
Its something i recently learned so it takes a bit longer. It also really depends on how much you have to update. I also started a new report.
