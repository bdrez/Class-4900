12/2-12/8
This week as a busy one. I continued working on my report i started last week. This site has two differnet company camera so there are extra steps involve. I had to have 
one of my supervisiors help me with IPro camera settings and we did them over the server on the IPro application. I was able to finish this report and start working on a
new one. I also went over site pictures with another intern to help them and got more training. I started working on a new report that has a few issues so its taking a bit 
long than normal. I also helped train a newer intern going over the report process with her.
