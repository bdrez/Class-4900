This week was a busy one. I continued working on my report I started last week. This site has two different company cameras so there are extra steps involved. I had to have 
one of my supervisors helped me with IPro camera settings and we did them over the server on the IPro application. I was able to finish this report and start working on a
new one. I also went over site pictures with another intern to help them and got more training. I started working on a new report that has a few issues so its taking a bit 
longer than normal. I also helped train a newer intern going over the report process with her.
