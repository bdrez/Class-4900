This week was a busy one. I continued working on my report I started last week. This site has two different company cameras so there are extra steps involved. I had to
have one of my supervisors helped me with IPro camera settings and we did them over the server on the IPro application. I was able to finish this report and start working
on a new one. I also went over site pictures with another intern to help them and got more training. I started working on a new report that has a few issues so its taking
a bit longer than normal. I also helped train a newer intern going over the report process with her. 

This week i will explain what a Checksum is:
A checksum is a method to verify the integrity of the data. You compare the checksum of the data you send vs the checksum of the data you received. If they are the same  
that means the data is good and was not tampered with. If the checksum is not the same, that indicates that data integrity is at risk.
