# Class-4900
This repository will keep track of my Internship at the NYC DOE DIIT IPDVS team that I will be using for class 4900. 
My primary interest is cyber security. A lot of cyber security jobs require at least one year of IT, which I am doing by interning at the NYC DOE DIIT. I am personally trying to
make connections between my everyday IT work and cyber security through this repository.
