This week i continued to work on my remote assessment. Beside for this site having issues theres also two servers as well as two archivers in Genetec. This means that some 
parts are taking twice as long. Aditionally, i went on site to a school and surveyed the cameras, MDF room, one IDF, some electrical pannels, and the MVS.
