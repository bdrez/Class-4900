This week i continued to work on my remote assessment. Beside for this site having issues theres also two servers as well as two archivers in Genetec. This means that some 
parts are taking twice as long. Aditionally, i went on site to a school and surveyed the cameras, MDF room, one IDF, some electrical pannels, and the MVS. I learned how to 
unfreeze a pc/ Main Viewing Station and was able to help the School Safety Agent with theirs. I also learned how to change the web interface on the KVM. The older 
interface did not allow me to use the shift key/symbols, but changing it to the new interface allowed me to do so.

How to unfreeze a pc/MVS
1 Press control, alt, delete
2 A pop up screen should show up one of the option should be to log out
3YYou should be able to log in as normal and not have a frozen screen anymore 

how to change the interface on the KVM
1 click the number 1 button a couple of time (might have to give it a minutes)
2 Then click on the 1 KVM switch button 
3 give it a few minutes then once you log in again you should have the newer interface
