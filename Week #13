This week I finished going through site pictures and finishing up the report. I also helped someone with their site picture regarding their report. We also got some 
trainingregarding looking at potential cameras on the plan. Learning what to look for and what to do. We also got additional training and I worked on the server project. 

I attended my last codepath class. We presented our capstone and fixed it up a bit based on feedback. I also studied for the ISC2 CC and passed it this week!
