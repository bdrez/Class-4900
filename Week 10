This week i meet with my supervisor and the other full time employee to go over site pictures because there was some issues at that site like lack of labeling, cameras not 
set up correctly and cameras taken offline. Together we were able to figure out what issues are important and go on the report and what issues we can leave out. I was able 
to finish this report.  I also started a brand new report that has been set up well so far and has no major issues. As well as, circle back to another report to finish by 
checking the school's field of view. I also asked one of my supervisors for help because a lot of the four way cameras had a 2 second blind spot. I also attend my codepath 
class this week and worked on the homework.
