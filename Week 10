This week i meet with my supervisior and the other full time employee to go over site pictures because there was some issues at that site like lack of labeling, cameras not set
up correctly and cameras taken offline. Togthere we were abel to figure out what issues are improtant and go on the report and what issues we can leave out. I was able to 
finish this report.  I also started a brand new report that has been set up well so far and has no major issues. As well as, circle back to another report to finish by checking
the schools feild of veiw. I also asked one of my supervisiors for help because a lot of the four way cameras had a 2 second blind spot. I also attend my code path class this 
week adnd worked on the hoemwork.
