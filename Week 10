This week i meet with my supervisor and the other full time employee to go over site pictures because there was some issues at that site like lack of labeling, cameras not 
set up correctly and cameras taken offline. Together we were able to figure out which issues are important enough to go on the report and which issues we can let go of. I 
was able to finish this report.  I also started a brand new report that has been set up well so far and has no major issues. As well as, circle back to another report to 
finish by checking the school's field of view. I also asked one of my supervisors for help because a lot of the four way cameras had a 2 second blind spot. I also attend 
my codepath class this week and worked on the homework. 

When fixing the Gentec settings on the server side we deal with different types of ports:

Port 80 - This allows us to have an HTTP connection that is unsecure. 
Port 443- This allows us to have a secure HTTPS connection. 
Port 550- This allows us to remote desktop access or viewer connections (VNC), but its official register for legacy service.

It is always a good security practice to close your ports after they are used to prevent unwanted access into your systems through these ports.

Bellow i will list some other popular ports:
Port 21- FTP- this is use for simple file transfer 
Port 22-SSH- this allows us to secure shell which allows for a secure remote terminal access,
Port 25--SMTP- this allows us to send emails over the network
