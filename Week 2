This week I continued working after my small break. I started working on a remote assessment for a school. Making sure the software and systems are set up according to the 
DOE standards. I worked on that throughout the short week. On Friday, I remotely helped one of the newer interns with how to do an on-site assessment, and ensured they
didn't forget any steps.

One of the things I have to check on the software is the LSA RAID arrays(Redundant Array of Independent Disks). I recently learned what this is when studying for my
Security+ exam. Since I didn't know what it was prior, I figured I would share a video about the most common types of RAID arrays-0, 1, 5, 10.

RAIDS in short:

RAID 0 is striping- meaning the data is split across multiple drives.

RAID 1 is mirroring- meaning the data is copied identically and has an extra copy stored.

RAID 5 is striping with parity- meaning the data is split across multiple drives and parity allows for data to be reconstructed if failed.

RAID 10 is striping and mirroring- it combines the advantages of both RAID 1 and RAID 0.
