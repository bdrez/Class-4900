This week i went back to work after the holiday. I started working on a new site with two servers. It was intresting because the first server was set up pretty well and 
there were no major issues, but the second server was not as well set up and took longer to go through. As well as, begin  going through some of the site pictures to check the 
physical set up. I also prearped and presented my live demo for this class.  Additionaly, i attended my code path class and worked on the lab.
