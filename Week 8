This week i went back to work after the holiday. I started working on a new site with two servers. It was intresting because the first server was set up pretty well and there
was no major issues, but the second server was not as well set up and took longer to go through. I also prearped and presented my live demo for this class.  Additionaly, i 
attended my code path class and worked on the lab.
