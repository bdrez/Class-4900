This week I went back to work after the holiday. I started working on a new site with two servers. It was interesting because the first server was set up pretty well and 
there were no major issues, but the second server was not as well set up and took longer to go through. As well as, begin  going through some of the site pictures to 
check the physical set up. I also prepared and presented my live demo for this class.  Additionally, I attended my code path class and worked in the lab.

This week i will explain some linux commands that we use:

ipconfig - this is used to get the devices IP
We do this on the MVS on site to make sure we got the correct IP which will allow us to do our work most efficiently.

hostname- this is used to get us the name associated with the device 
Similar to above we do this to ensure we have the proper name of the device if needed. 

ping - this allows us to test if we can reach a device over the network. 
We usually do this to make sure the MVS is online and if we have trouble logging into genetec with a certain ip.
